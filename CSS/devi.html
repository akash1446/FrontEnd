  It usually means showing two or more colors separated across a region (like a box, row, or background), with the boundary or blend occurring along a **diagonal line**, instead of vertically or horizontally.
  Diagonal Color with CSS Linear Gradient.
  The  linear-gradient function lets you blend colors in any direction—including diagonally.
  background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color1, color2);
  To make the transition go diagonally (like from top-left to bottom-right), use to bottom right
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, yellow) This starts with red at the top-left and blends to yellow at the bottom-right.
  You can also use an angle.
  background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, red, yellow);
  You can add more colors/stops for complex effects. 
  In Excel: Diagonal Cell Color Split
 Excel doesn’t let you directly split a cell's background color, but you can simulate a diagonal split:
1. Select the cell.
2.Right-click > Format Cells > Border, and pick a diagonal border (to create the dividing line).
3. Add color:
   - Use "Fill" to color the whole cell.
   - Or, insert a shape (like a triangle) and fill just one half.
   - Adjust text alignment for each half (top left, bottom right).
  * Diagonal format = colors transition along a diagonal, not side-to-side or top-to-bottom.
  * Try CSS gradients for the web, clever tricks for Excel, or selection/fill tools in art programs.If you want, practice by:
  - Writing a simple CSS rule for a diagonal background, or
  - Trying to color half an Excel cell diagonally
